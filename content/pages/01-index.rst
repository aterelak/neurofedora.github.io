Welcome to the NeuroFedora blog.

NeuroFedora is a volunteer driven initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora
based `Free/Open Source <https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software>`__
Software platform for neuroscience. We believe that similar to Free Software,
science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study. The use of
Free Software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the
research community. By making the tools used in the scientific process easier
to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.

This blog is used to `provide updates <./blog_index.html>`__ and share information related to
NeuroFedora. Documentation on using and contributing to NeuroFedora is hosted at
https://neuro.fedoraproject.org.

We are always looking for more volunteers to help us do more. The various
contributor roles that we currently have set up can be found in the
`contributor documentation
<https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/contributing/#_contributor_roles>`__.
You can even create a new role for yourself! Our volunteers generally work a
few hours a week on NeuroFedora.

Please use any of the communication channels from the top navigation bar to get
in touch with the NeuroFedora community.
