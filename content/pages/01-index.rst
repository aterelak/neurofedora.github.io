Welcome to the NeuroFedora blog. NeuroFedora is an initiative to provide a
ready to use Fedora based `Free/Open source
<https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software>`__ software platform for
neuroscience. We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free
for all to use, share, modify, and study. The use of Free software also aids
reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community. By
making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims
to take a step to enable this ideal.

This blog is used to `provide updates <./blog_index.html>`__ and share information related to
NeuroFedora. Documentation on using and contributing to NeuroFedora is hosted at
https://neuro.fedoraproject.org.
