This post departs from the usual template, mainly because we have new artwork
to show off and so will, for once, not use the logo in this post.

I had only half jokingly suggested a "terminator panda" to give the badge a bit
of a fun and was very pleasantly surprised when tanvi_ came up with a concept
art! After an iteration or two, blackfile_'s concept that included the logo was
merged with the panda terminator to give us the final one that's shown here.

For those who may not be aware, "`Fedora badges`_ is a fun website built to
recognize contributors to the Fedora Project, help new and existing Fedora
contributors find different ways to get involved, and encourage the improvement
of Fedora's infrastructure." You can learn about them more on the website's
about page, `here <https://badges.fedoraproject.org/about>`__.

So, please `join the team
<https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/contributing/>`__, do
whatever interests you: software packaging, testing, designing, documentation
writing, simply speak about Free Software, or absolutely anything that will
help us make Science similarly Free for everyone. The current team is listed
`here in the Pagure neuro-sig group <https://pagure.io/group/neuro-sig>`__.

Since we're going to present a poster at `CNS*2019
<https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2019-quick>`__, and meet at `Flock
<https://flocktofedora.org/>`__, we also `requested
<https://pagure.io/design/issue/627>`__ the `Fedora Design team
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design>`__ to make us a sticker that we could
give out. They, of course, delivered---they always do! After a few iterations
under duffy_'s guidance, tanvi_, terezahl_, and asrootuser_ put forward ideas
that resulted in this beauty:

I've `ordered a batch of stickers off Stickermule
<https://www.stickermule.com/uk/artworks/3195402?token=caa3f965c743f145a3d15e133565452a>`__
already. Since the artwork is now part of Stickermule's catalogue, I can also
easily re-order more in the future. I *think* others can too, but I'm not sure.
In any case, the sources for the stickers, like our logo are on `here on our
Pagure repository
<https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/blob/master/f/Artwork>`__. In the
future, depending on how much funding we can gather, we may even be able to
send stickers to folks. For the moment, though, we'll only give them out to
people we meet at conferences to save on postage.


(Please read through the `Trademark Guidelines
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Trademark_guidelines>`__ before using and
sharing any Fedora related content, by the way.)


At the end of the post, here the usual short update on the state of software in
NeuroFedora_:

- `python-elephant <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-elephant>`__ is
  now included in the Fedora repositories.
- `python-PyLaTeX <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-pylatex>`__ also.
- `python-neurosynth <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-neurosynth>`__
  was also added.

We're still working on including more tools. NEST 2.18.0 `was recently released
<https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/releases/tag/v2.18.0>`__ so we'll
update that soon also. Still `quite a queue for us to work through
<https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues?status=Open&tags=S%3A+Needs+packaging>`__,
but we're making steady progress!
