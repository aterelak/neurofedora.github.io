More software has been submitted for review and included in NeuroFedora_. We
keep making steady progress on that front. Please keep an eye on our
documentation to see what new tools are now available for use in NeuroFedora_

We have also submitted an abstract for `CNS*2019`_ to present at poster at the conference
introducing NeuroFedora to the computational neuroscience research community.
So, we do hope to see you there (Ankur will be at `CNS*2019`_ anyway).

We are always looking for more people to join the team. At the moment, we are
looking for people to fill these two roles:

- Spin/Lab master: to have a ready-to-use downloadable ISO, we'd like to work
  on a Fedora based NeuroFedora "lab". We are looking for a `spin/lab master
  <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/neuro-sig@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5DAKTDPJRRSLCB76EGYH7K5RACEFYTMU/>`__
  to lead this goal.  `(What is a Fedora spin/lab?)
  <https://labs.fedoraproject.org/>`__. The skills needed for this task are:

  - knowledge of Git_ and Git_ based workflows: Pagure_/Gitlab_/Github_/Bitbucket_.
  - knowledge of how DNF_ works.
  - knowledge of the Fedora Spin process and associated tools (kickstart files, for example).

- Documentation master: given how important end-user documentation is, we are
  looking for a documentation master to ensure ours is up to the mark. For this
  role, the required skills are:

  - knowledge of Git_ and Git_ based workflows: Pagure_/Gitlab_/Github_/Bitbucket_.
  - knowledge of Asciidoc_ and Antora_.
  - knowledge of Docker_.

If any of these roles interest you, please get in touch with the NeuroFedora_
team. You needn't have these skills already---you can learn these from the
NeuroFedora_ team as you go along.

The next Open NeuroFedora meeting is on the `26th of March at 2200GMT/UTC
<https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=NeuroFedora+team+meeting+%232&iso=20190326T22&p1=136&ah=1>`__.
We will discuss our progress, and what we need to do next. It is time we
started preparing for `CNS*2019`_ too, so we will discuss what software we
would like to showcase there.

The meeting will be held on our `IRC/Telegram channel
<https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help>`__.
It is open for all to attend. Please pop by!

---------

NeuroFedora_ is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us `here
<https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help>`__.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.
