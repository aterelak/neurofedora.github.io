After the recent release of the `Computational Neuroscience installable OS
image <https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/comp-neuro>`__, the NeuroFedora_ team
is looking to work on to the next set of deliverables. For this, we need to
expand the team.

*I want to note that we are not only looking for people that may already have
the necessary skills. We are looking for anyone interested in working in these
areas that would perhaps like to acquire the required skills. We will teach the
skills that we can, and where we cannot, we will involve experienced members of
the Free/Open Source software community to help us. All one really needs is a
few hours a week of free time.*

We are looking for people interested in:

- Scientific communication, marketing, outreach, and community engagement:

  - To spread information on the staggering amount of Free/Open Source Software
    that is available for Neuroscience to researchers and the community in
    general,

  - To disseminate the progress that the NeuroFedora_ team makes regularly to
    the community.

  - To just generally monitor our various communication channels to answer
    queries and participate in discussions with the team and users.


- Software development:

  - There are still about `200 tools
    <https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues>`__ to include in
    NeuroFedora_, so still lots of work to do here. Some tools related to
    computational neuroscience remain, so we are working on those. However, we
    want to start making some headway on the next deliverable that will be
    focussed on neuroimaging and data analysis. Not only do we need to build
    these tools from source, we also need to test them regularly, and push new
    versions to our users when developers make new releases.

  - We also want to provide easy to use containers for all the tools that we
    are including in NeuroFedora_.

- Neuro-imaging and data analysis in Neuroscience:

  - A lot of tools on our list are related to Neuro-imaging and data analysis.
    To effectively integrate these with the rest of NeuroFedora_, we need more
    people with domain knowledge. If you work these areas or want to work in
    them and would like to learn more about these tools, NeuroFedora_ is a
    great informal environment to start in.


It is common knowledge that joining Free/Open source communities is an excellent
way to pick up skills and experience. So, I especially encourage students to
join one, even if it is not NeuroFedora_.

I also have first hand experience of how busy a PhD candidate can get, but in
my experience I also found it possible to free up a few hours a week to work on
developing general skills that one may not necessarily be able to learn from
daily research work. So, I also strongly encourage undergraduate/postgraduate
research students and Ph.D. candidates to do the same.
