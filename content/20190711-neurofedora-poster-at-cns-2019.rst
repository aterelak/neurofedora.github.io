With `CNS*2019`_ around the `corner
<https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2019-calendar>`__, we worked on getting the
NeuroFedora_ poster ready for the poster presentation session. Our poster is
**P96**, on the first poster session on `the 14th of July
<https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2019-poster-presentation-guide#14>`__. The poster
is also shown below:

The current team already consists of more people than the authors listed on the
poster. The authors here were only the first set, and as the team grows, so
will our author list for future publications. In general, we follow the
standard rule: if one has contributed to the project since the previous
publication, they get their name on the poster.

Unfortunately, this time, no one from the team is able to attend the
conference, but if you are there and want to learn more about NeuroFedora_,
please get in touch with us using any of our communication channels.

To everyone that will be in Barcelona for the conference, we hope you have a
fruitful one, and of course, we hope you are able to make some time to rest at
the beach too.
