:summary: It is time we started preparing for Flock_!

.. include:: logo.txt

This year, Flock_ will be held in Budapest from August 8--11.
As part of NeuroFedora_, we've already proposed a talk to discuss how Free/Open
source software links very very well with Free/Open science. Please see the
proposal here, and give feedback: https://pagure.io/flock/issue/112.


Apart from that, given that a large number of community members congregate at
Flock_, it may be a good chance to get together those of us that work in
science/research and related areas. So, if you are planning to attend Flock_
and work in, or are interested in science/research, please drop a note at this
tracker ticket: https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/242

If we have enough of us, we can look at proposing a hackathon also. The first
round of CFPs for flock starts on June 1. So we won't make it for that. We
should be able to make it for the second round on June 15, though.

Please, spread the word!
