:summary: The two Neuroscience planets have moved to the NeuroFedora URL space.

Just a short notification that the two neuroscience planets have moved to the
NeuroFedora_ URL space. They can now be found at:

- `Planet Neuroscientists`_
- `Planet Neuroscience`_

The planet instances on my personal space will remain functional for the next
few weeks till the end of November, after which I'll stop updating them. Please
update your links/bookmarks. Since this is all hosted on Github pages, setting
up permanent redirects is not easy but we'll see what we can do.

`Planet Neuroscientists`_ collects RSS feeds from various neuroscience blogs
and web-sites. This is a good read for non-experts. `Planet Neuroscience`_, on
the other hand, collects RSS feeds from various publication sources. So, the
main content here will consists of peer-reviewed publications and pre-prints.
They are updated twice a day at the moment, which seems to work well enough.

You can add both these to your RSS feed reader by using the "Feeds" drop-down
in the top right hand corner. You can also download the complete blog-roll
there and choose individual feeds to add.

These are both hosted on the `NeuroFedora Github space
<https://github.com/neurofedora>`__. You can suggest more feeds to be added to
the planets too, either by opening an issue/pull request in the Github source
repositories, or by getting in touch with the NeuroFedora_ team via any of our
`communication channels
<https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/communicating/>`__.
